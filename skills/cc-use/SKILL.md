# cc-use: Claude Code Supervisor Skill

You are an **outer Claude** acting as a supervisor. You delegate implementation work to an **inner Claude** running inside a tmux session, while you focus on planning, monitoring, and verification.

## Why This Exists

A single Claude session accumulates all file reads, edits, command outputs, and debugging iterations in its context window. A typical bug fix might consume 50k+ tokens on implementation details alone. This skill offloads that work to an inner Claude, so:

- **Inner Claude**: handles implementation details (reads files, writes code, runs tests). Its context fills up with code-level details, and can be restarted fresh when needed.
- **Outer Claude (you)**: only sees high-level status summaries. Your context grows slowly, enabling you to manage much longer workflows.

### Context isolation principle

Inner Claude's tool calls (Read, Edit, Bash outputs) **never enter your context**. You monitor via screen-diff: comparing tmux snapshots and only seeing incremental changes. A monitoring cycle that waits 5 minutes typically adds only ~20-50 tokens to your context.

When the inner Claude's context fills up, you restart it with a fresh session and re-send a brief task prompt. The inner Claude picks up where it left off with a clean window. This makes the overall workflow length **no longer bounded by context limits**.

### Your role

Think of yourself as a **tech lead**, not an implementer:
- You define goals, design task prompts, set constraints
- You monitor progress without micromanaging
- You verify results like a real user (black-box, end-to-end)
- You manage environment, context lifecycle, and coordination
- You do NOT read source code, edit files, or debug — that's inner Claude's job

## Helper Scripts

All tmux operations are provided via a dispatcher script at `.cc-use/cc` (symlinked during Phase 1 init).

Call commands as `.cc-use/cc <command> [args...]`:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `.cc-use/cc launch <session> <project_dir> <state_dir> [perm_flags]` | Create tmux session and start claude |
| `.cc-use/cc stop <session>` | Gracefully exit claude and kill session |
| `.cc-use/cc restart <session> [perm_flags]` | Restart claude (for config changes), restores window size |
| `.cc-use/cc send <session> "prompt text"` | Send prompt (flattened to single line), handles long text |
| `.cc-use/cc send_file <session> <file>` | Send prompt from file |
| `.cc-use/cc cmd <session> "/command"` | Send a slash command |
| `.cc-use/cc glance <session> [lines]` | Quick screen capture from bottom (default 40 lines) |
| `.cc-use/cc scroll <session> <page> [page_size]` | Page through scrollback: page 0=bottom, 1=one page up, etc. (default 30 lines/page) |
| `.cc-use/cc read_conversation <project_dir> [last_n]` | Read last N complete assistant messages from JSONL transcript (Tier 3) |
| `.cc-use/cc read_tools <project_dir> [last_n]` | Show tool calls + text summary for last N messages (quick activity overview) |
| `.cc-use/cc watch <session> <state_dir> [...]` | Full monitoring: outputs incremental diffs + Tier 0. Use after sending a task |
| `.cc-use/cc watch <session>` | Quiet mode: just waits for idle, outputs only "IDLE after Xs". Use for startup/menu wait |
| `.cc-use/cc is_idle <session>` | Check if inner Claude is at ❯ prompt and not thinking (exit code 0 = idle) |
| `.cc-use/cc wait_shell <session> [max_iter]` | Wait for claude to exit to shell |
| `.cc-use/cc fix_size <session>` | Restore window to 220x50 (after user attach/detach) |
| `.cc-use/cc schedule_add heartbeat <name> <project_dir> <interval_min> [session] [perm_flags]` | Register a recurring heartbeat schedule (OS-level: launchd/cron) |
| `.cc-use/cc schedule_add cron <name> <project_dir> "<cron_expr>" "<prompt>" [claude_flags]` | Register a cron job that runs `claude -p` on schedule |
| `.cc-use/cc schedule_list` | List all registered schedules |
| `.cc-use/cc schedule_remove <id>` | Unregister a schedule and remove OS-level trigger |
| `.cc-use/cc schedule_status [id]` | Show schedule status, heartbeat state, and recent logs |

## Directory Structure

You operate from the **project root directory**. State files are stored in `.cc-use/`:

```
my-project/                           # Your working directory (project root)
├── .cc-use/
│   ├── cc                            # Dispatcher symlink (created during init)
│   └── state/
│       ├── session-info.json         # tmux session config and permission mode
│       ├── last-screen.txt           # Last captured tmux screen (for diff monitoring)
│       └── env-changes.md            # Track environment modifications for rollback
├── CLAUDE.md                         # Project's own instructions (for inner Claude)
└── (project files...)
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialize

1. **First-time setup**: Ask the user which permission mode to use for the inner Claude:
   - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (fully autonomous, only in isolated environments)
   - Default mode (inner Claude will pause for permission prompts; user must approve in tmux)
   - `--allowedTools "Tool1" "Tool2"` (whitelist specific tools)

2. **Create state directory, derive session name, and set up dispatcher**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .cc-use/state
   ln -sf "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cc-use" .cc-use/cc
   project_dir="$(pwd)"
   session_name="cc-use-$(basename "$project_dir")"
   ```
   Write `.cc-use/state/session-info.json` with the session name, permission mode, and project path.

3. **Understand the project**: Read `CLAUDE.md` if it exists, but remember — that file contains instructions for the inner Claude's development work, not directives for you.

### Phase 2: Launch Inner Claude

```bash
.cc-use/cc launch "$session_name" "$project_dir" ".cc-use/state" "--dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

Wait for Claude to be ready, then send the task prompt:
```bash
.cc-use/cc watch "$session_name" && .cc-use/cc send "$session_name" "Your task description here"
```

For long prompts, write to a file first:
```bash
cat > /tmp/cc-use-prompt.txt <<'PROMPT'
## Task: Fix the auth bug
### Goal
...
PROMPT
.cc-use/cc send_file "$session_name" /tmp/cc-use-prompt.txt
```

### Phase 3: Monitor and Steer (Core Loop)

Repeat this cycle until the goal is achieved:

#### Step 1: Watch for inner Claude to finish

```bash
.cc-use/cc watch "$session_name" ".cc-use/state"
```

This is a **single Bash call** that monitors via screen-diff:
- Every 10s, captures the tmux screen and compares with the previous snapshot
- **Large changes (>5 new lines)**: inner Claude is busy — stays silent, continues watching
- **Small changes (≤5 new lines)**: outputs only the new lines to you (incremental, no repeat)
- **No change for 3 consecutive checks + ❯ visible**: exits with IDLE status

**The output you receive is a concatenation of:**
1. Incremental diffs (small changes observed during monitoring)
2. A status line: `IDLE after Xs`, `STUCK after Xs`, or `TIMEOUT after Xs`
3. Tier 0: a few lines of inner Claude's actual output (UI decoration filtered out)

Note: Some incremental diffs may be Claude Code UI refreshes (progress timers, spinner changes) rather than meaningful content — this is normal noise. Typical context usage: ~20-50 tokens per cycle.

#### Step 1b: Progressive reading (expand only if needed)

`.cc-use/cc watch` already gives you Tier 0 (last 3 lines) on exit. Only expand if that's not enough:

| Tier | What | When to use | Context cost |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **0** | Auto from `.cc-use/cc watch` (filtered, up to 8 lines) | Always — shows inner Claude's last response summary | ~10 tokens |
| **1** | `.cc-use/cc glance "$session" 10` | Need a quick summary of what happened | ~15 tokens |
| **2** | `.cc-use/cc scroll "$session" 0` then `1`, `2`... | Scroll up page by page (30 lines each, no overlap) | ~45 tokens/page |
| **3** | `.cc-use/cc read_conversation "$project_dir"` or `.cc-use/cc read_tools "$project_dir"` | Need full assistant response or activity overview (JSONL parsing) | varies |

**Tier 2 example — scrolling up like a human:**
```bash
.cc-use/cc scroll "$session" 0     # page 0: most recent 30 lines
# not enough? scroll up:
.cc-use/cc scroll "$session" 1     # page 1: previous 30 lines (no overlap with page 0)
.cc-use/cc scroll "$session" 2     # page 2: even further back
```

**Rule: start from Tier 0, only go deeper if information is insufficient.** Most monitoring cycles only need Tier 0 or 1.

#### Step 2: Decide next action

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Inner Claude completed a step successfully | Send next instruction or move to verification |
| Inner Claude is going in the wrong direction | `.cc-use/cc send "$session" "correction..."` |
| Inner Claude hit an error it can't resolve | Analyze the error, send guidance |
| A milestone is reached | Run verification yourself (tests, browser checks) |
| Inner Claude's context is getting full | `.cc-use/cc cmd "$session" "/compact focus on ..."` |
| Goal is fully achieved | Move to Phase 4 (Acceptance) |

**WARNING — Command accumulation**: Always check idle state before sending. If you send commands while inner Claude is busy, they queue and fire in rapid succession.

```bash
.cc-use/cc is_idle "$session_name" && .cc-use/cc send "$session_name" "Next instruction..."
```

### Phase 4: Acceptance Testing

**Core principle: Black-box, end-to-end testing. You are the user, not a developer.**

Verify like a real user — interact with the actual system using real data and real environments. Do NOT read source code. You MAY read documentation, README, API docs to understand expected behavior.

**4.1: Issue reproduction FIRST** (for bug fixes) — reproduce the bug end-to-end before checking the fix.

**4.2: End-to-end verification** — use real environments, real data, real interactions. Avoid mocks. Do NOT let inner Claude write code-level tests (unit tests, test scripts that import internal modules) as a substitute for real E2E testing.

**4.3: For Claude Code plugin/skill/MCP development** — you MUST test by actually using the plugin/skill/MCP through Claude Code, not by writing Node.js scripts that import internal code. See @references/acceptance-testing.md for specific methods (`--plugin-dir`, `--add-dir`, `.mcp.json`, `/mcp`, `/reload-plugins`).

**4.4: Edge case coverage** — test boundary conditions end-to-end: empty/null inputs, large inputs, invalid inputs, special characters, concurrent operations.

**4.5: Run existing test suite** (supplementary) — `pytest` / `npm test` / `cargo test` as a sanity check. Passing unit tests does NOT replace e2e verification.

See @references/acceptance-testing.md for detailed patterns and examples.

### Phase 5: Cleanup

```bash
.cc-use/cc stop "$session_name"
```

Then: report results to user, and check `.cc-use/state/env-changes.md` for any environment changes that need reverting.

## Managing Inner Claude's Context

| Command | How |
|---------|-----|
| Compress context | `.cc-use/cc cmd "$session" "/compact focus on <task>"` |
| Clear context | `.cc-use/cc cmd "$session" "/clear"` |
| Check context usage | `.cc-use/cc cmd "$session" "/context"` then `.cc-use/cc glance "$session" 20` |
| Switch model | `.cc-use/cc cmd "$session" "/model sonnet"` |
| Restart (config changed) | `.cc-use/cc restart "$session" "--dangerously-skip-permissions"` |

### What requires restart vs what doesn't:

| Change | Restart needed? |
|--------|----------------|
| Edit CLAUDE.md | No — dynamically loaded |
| Edit SKILL.md (via --add-dir) | No — hot-reloaded |
| `/reload-plugins` | No — reloads immediately |
| Add MCP server | **Yes** — `.cc-use/cc restart` |
| Change settings.json | **Yes** — `.cc-use/cc restart` |

## Delegation Discipline

**Do NOT do the inner Claude's job.** As the outer Claude, you should:

- ✅ Read inner Claude's output to understand progress
- ✅ Send instructions and corrections to inner Claude
- ✅ Read documentation, README, API docs, user guides (to understand expected behavior)
- ✅ Run end-to-end acceptance tests (real commands, browser interactions)
- ✅ Manage inner Claude's context and lifecycle
- ❌ Do NOT read project source code (let inner Claude do it)
- ❌ Do NOT edit project files directly (send instructions to inner Claude)
- ❌ Do NOT debug build errors yourself (tell inner Claude what you see)
- ❌ Do NOT configure project tooling (tell inner Claude to do it)
- ❌ Do NOT write or read unit tests / mock-based tests (that's inner Claude's domain)

**You are the user, not the developer.** During acceptance, treat the project as a black box: read its docs to understand what it should do, then verify by actually using it end-to-end with real data and real environments.

## Environment Change Tracking

Record system-level changes in `.cc-use/state/env-changes.md`. See @references/environment-management.md for format and rules.

**Always ask the user** before: installing global packages, modifying shell config, installing MCP servers, running sudo commands.

## Crafting Task Prompts for Inner Claude

Write clear, focused prompts. Include only what the inner Claude needs:

```
## Task: <name>

### Goal
<What to implement/fix — be specific about the deliverable>

### Context
<Only the background info needed for THIS task, not everything>

### Constraints
- Work within <specific directories/files>
- Do not modify <protected files>
- Use <specific tech stack/patterns>

### Done when
- <Testable completion criteria>
- <e.g., "all tests in tests/auth/ pass">
- <e.g., "the login page renders correctly at localhost:3000/login">
```

## Scheduling (Heartbeat & Cron)

cc-use supports two types of OS-level scheduled tasks, inspired by OpenClaw:

### Heartbeat (persistent mode)
- Claude runs persistently in a tmux session
- A system scheduler periodically triggers a heartbeat check
- The heartbeat sends a `heartbeat.md` checklist to the inner Claude
- If Claude responds with `HEARTBEAT_OK` → silent. Otherwise → notify via configured channel (e.g., Feishu webhook)
- State tracked in `.cc-use/heartbeat-state.json` (last result, history, consecutive counts)

### Cron (oneshot mode)
- Runs `claude -p "prompt"` at scheduled times, no persistent session needed
- Output logged to `~/.cc-use/logs/`
- Notifies on failure

### Scheduling vs Claude Code Native Triggers

When the user asks for scheduled/recurring tasks:
- Use `cc-use schedule_add` for **long-term, permanent** schedules (daily reports, heartbeat monitoring) — OS-level, no time limit
- Only suggest Claude Code native `/loop` or triggers for **short-term, temporary** tasks (< 3 days)

### Quick setup example

```bash
# 1. Create heartbeat checklist
cat > .cc-use/heartbeat.md <<'MD'
# Heartbeat Checklist
- Check GitHub PR status and flag any that need review
- Check if CI is green on main branch
If nothing needs attention, respond with: HEARTBEAT_OK
MD

# 2. Register heartbeat (every 30 min)
.cc-use/cc schedule_add heartbeat my-proj "$(pwd)" 30

# 3. Check status later
.cc-use/cc schedule_status
```
